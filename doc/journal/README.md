Journal Manuals
---------------

This folder contains archived Journal Manuals published by Frontier to document the JSON format of Player Journal events.

More documentation for the Player Journal can be found here:

* [Player Tools & API Discussions Forum](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/forums/elite-api-and-tools/)
* [Elite: Dangerous Codex](https://edcodex.info/?m=doc)
* [Elite Dangerous Player Journal on readthedocs.io](https://elite-journal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Unfortunately Frontier stopped publishing Journal Manuals after v37 or I am not smart enough to find them. If you know where to find newer documentation then please let me know. I am also interested in PDF or DOC files for the versions 17, 19, 21, 24 and 29 (if they exists), so I complete this archive.
